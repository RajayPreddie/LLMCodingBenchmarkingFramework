    "solution_code": "The problem requires to find all the indexes in string `s` where an anagram of string `p` starts. An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. This is a very common problem and can be solved using Sliding Window technique.\n\nFirst, create a dictionary with frequency count of characters in string p.\n\nCheck each substring of length of string `p` in string `s`. If an anagram is found, add the starting index to the result list.\n\nTo implement the Sliding Window, start with a window that encompasses the whole string p. Then, for each new character in s, incrementally shrink the window from the left by removing the frequency count of the leftmost character of the window, and extend the window from the right by adding the frequency count for the new character.\n\nA detailed python solution is as follows:\n\n```Python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_anagrams(s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:\n    lenS, lenP = len(s), len(p)\n    countP, countS = Counter(p), Counter(s[:lenP-1])\n    index = []\n\n    for i in range(lenP-1,lenS):\n        # add new char in s into countS\n        countS[s[i]] += 1   \n        # if countS is same as countP\n        if countS == countP:   \n            index.append(i-lenP+1)\n        # delete the leftmost char\n        countS[s[i-lenP+1]] -= 1 \n        if countS[s[i-lenP+1]] == 0:\n            del countS[s[i-lenP+1]]  \n    return index\n```\n\nThis implementation has a complexity of O(n) because it iterates over the string s only once.\n\nIn this solution, we are using `collections.Counter` to compare the character frequency for string `s` and `p`.\n\nFor each new character we receive in s (denoted as `right`), we increment its count in the sliding window `count` dictionary. Then, if `right` has burdened too much, making the two counters `count` and `pCount` different, an anagram cannot be formed with `right`. So we need to remove the `left` part of the substring from the window, and decrease its count in `count`.\n\nWhen `right` moves and the `count` map is the same as `pCount`, we find a qualified substring. Then we increment the result by 1.\n\nWhen `left` moves, we decrease its count in `count`. If the value is 0, we need to remove `left` from `count`.",
