Sort the `intervals` list by each interval's start time.\n2. Create a variable `res` and set it as an empty list. It's used to store the new intervals.\n3. Iterate `i` over each `interval` in `intervals`.\n\t1. If `res` is empty or the last element's end in `res` is less than the `interval's` start, insert `interval` in `res`.\n\t2. If the last element's end in `res` is larger or equal to the `interval`s start, set the last element's end in `res` as the maximum between the last element's end in `res` and the `interval`'s end.\n4. Return `res`.\n\n# Dry Run\n## Input\n\tintervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]\n## Output\n\tResult = [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]\n## Execution\n1. Sorting the list: intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]\n2. Initialise `res` as an empty list\n3. Iterate over each `interval` in `intervals`\n\t1. The interval is [1, 3]\n\t\t- `res` is empty, so add the `interval` in `res`: `res` = [[1, 3]]\n\t2. The interval is [2, 6]\n\t\t- The last element's end [3] in `res` is less than the interval's start [2], so update the last element's end in `res` with a maximum between 3 and 6: `res` = [[1, 6]]\n\t3. The interval [8, 10]\n\t\t- The last element's end [6] in `res` is less than the interval's start [8], so add the `interval` in `res`: `res` = [[1, 6], [8, 10]]\n\t4. The interval is [15, 18]\n\t\t- The last element's end [10] in `res` is less than the interval's start [15], so add the `interval` in `res`: `res` = [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]",
