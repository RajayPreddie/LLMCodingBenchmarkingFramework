    "solution_code": "The function char_count(s) will take in a string as an argument and return a dictionary with keys as characters from the string and values as their respective counts or frequency of appearance.\n\nI will use Python's built-in collections.Counter() method which returns a dictionary with elements as keys and counts as values. \n\nHere is the Python code that implements this:\n\n```python \nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef char_count(s: str):\n    return dict(Counter(s))\n\n``` \n\nThe Counter function from collections module creates a dictionary with elements as keys and counts as values and the dict() function converts the Counter object back to a standard dictionary. \n\nFor example, if the input string is 'aabbcc', Counter(s) will return Counter({'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}), and dict(Counter(s)) will return {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}.",
