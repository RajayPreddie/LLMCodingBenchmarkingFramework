    "solution_code": "If characters in string T are not in order or there are multiple occurrences of characters in string T, then this problem can be reduced to a typical minimum window substring problem. But here as the characters in string T are in order and duplicates are allowed, that won't be possible directly here.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` for strings S and T. Start by finding the first window in S which contains all characters of T.\n2. While traversing the string S block by block, find the beginning of the window in linear time again and again.\n3. At the same time, keep updating the minimum length window. \n\nHere is a Python implementation of the above:\n\n```Python\ndef min_window(S: str, T: str) -> str:\n    N = len(S)\n    memo = [[None>0]*len(T) for _ in range(N)]\n    \n    # Memoization step\n    for i in range(N):\n        if S[i] == T[0]:\n            memo[i][0] = i\n        elif i > 0:\n            memo[i][0] = memo[i-1][0]\n    \n    for j in range(1, len(T)):\n        k = -1\n        for i in range(N):\n            if S[i] == T[j]:\n                memo[i][j] = k  \n            if k != -1 and i > 0:\n                memo[i][j] = min(memo[i][j], memo[i-1][j]) if memo[i][j] is not None else memo[i-1][j]\n            if i > 0 and S[i] != T[j]:\n                memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j]\n            if S[i] == T[j-1]:\n                k = memo[i][j-1]\n                \n    # Getting the minimum string\n    length = float('inf')\n    start = -1\n    for i, c in enumerate(memo):\n        if c[-1] is not None and i - c[-1] + 1 < length:\n            length = i - c[-1] + 1\n            start = c[-1]\n            \n    return S[start: start+length] if start != -1 else \"\"\n```\n\n`min_window` function uses dynamic programming to find the minimum window substring in O(N) time complexity. The `memo` array stores the indices of each character of string T. Then, we simply iterate over the `memo` array to find the minimum length window where T is a subsequence of. If no such window exists, then we return an empty string. If there are multiple minimum-length windows, then we get the one with the left-most starting index, as we are iterating from left to right.",
