    "solution_code": "The idea is to convert each list into a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of items that does not allow duplicates. Therefore, converting each list to a set automatically removes duplicates. Then, the intersection operation is performed on the two sets using the '&' operator or the intersection() function. The intersection operation returns a set that contains the common elements of the two sets. This set is then converted back to a list for the final output.\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this idea:\n\n```Python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef intersection_of_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    return list(set1 & set2)\n```\n\nThis function first converts the input lists into sets, then computes the intersection of the sets, and finally converts the resulting set back into a list. This approach guarantees that the result contains no duplicates because sets do not allow duplicates, and also that the result contains only elements that are common to both input lists, because that is what the intersection operation does.",
