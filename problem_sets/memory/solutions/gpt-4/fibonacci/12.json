    "solution_code": "First, lets define what a Fibonacci sequence is. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. This sequence often starts with 0 and 1. That is:\n\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...\n\nThe problem here is asking to return the nth Fibonacci number.\nWe'll solve this problem using a technique known as dynamic programming. \n\nIn dynamic programming we store the result of a subproblem so that when we need this result again, we do not recalculate and instead use the stored result. This can drastically reduce the time of calculations as we are avoiding re-computation of every subproblem solved.\n\nFor Fibonacci sequence, if we have already known fib(n - 1) and fib(n - 2), fib(n) will be easy to compute. That will be our approach.\n\n1. Declare an array dp and initialize it with 0.\n2. Let dp[0] = 0, and dp[1] = 1.\n3. For every number from 2 to n, let dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2].\n4. Return dp[n].\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) and space complexity is also O(n).\n\nLet's write the function \"fibonacci\" according to these steps.",
