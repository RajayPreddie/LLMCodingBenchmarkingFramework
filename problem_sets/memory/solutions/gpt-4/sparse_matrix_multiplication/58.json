We have 6 and 9 elements, the number of non zero elements are 13 which is less than quarter of the total elements. Implementing the optimum solution will reduce the number of the multiplication and addition operations.\n\nThe Algorithm  \n\n1. Get the non-zero elements of matrix B and store in the list b_non_zero = [((row, column), value)]  \n2. Get the non-zero elements of matrix A and store in the list a_non_zero = [((row, column), value)]  \n3. For each row from matrix A, multiply the non-zero elements with the non zero elements from the corresponding column of matrix B. The product is the element of the resulting matrix.  \n\nHow to get the non-zero element using minimum time complexity?  \n\nWe can use dictionary to get the matrix element using O(1) time complexity. To store as dictionary, the key is tuple of coordinates (row, column) and the value is the element of the matrix. {(row, column): Matrix[row, column]}\n\nStep 1.\n* Loop over the row of the matrix.\n   * Loop over the column of the matrix.\n      * If the element of the matrix is not equal to 0, then store in the b_non_zero list as ((rows, columns), matrix[rows][columns]))  \n\nStep2. The same as step 3 but we should consider each non-zero element of B. the muliplication \n\nStep3.  \n* Create a matrix of size n*c with all element 0\n* For each element of a multiply by its corresponding element from b, and add on the corresponding location of the matrix.\nThe location of the resulting is equal to the row of the element from A and the column of the element from B.",
